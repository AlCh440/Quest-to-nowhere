# Quest to nowhere
## Blue Powder

## Project description

This platformer is an alpha that has not developed enough yet, but I have expectations on. Right now there is only one level.
Though the early phases of the game, I hope you enjoy the character sprites as much as I did (check @penusbmic in insta, love the artist).


## Key Features

 - Auto scrolled platformer ! This may change in the future but it feels like you are really making progress.
 - F1 to restart the level
 - F5 to save the progress
 - F6 to load the saved progress
 - F9 to see colliders 
 - Use the arrows to move the camera around

## Controls

 - A and D to move around the map
 - SPACE to jump

## Developers

 - Albert Chica

## Quick notes

I did not know how to change the xml files to the Assets folder. I know this will take 50 per cent of my mark, so the best I can say is sorry and will search harder to fix it next delivery.
